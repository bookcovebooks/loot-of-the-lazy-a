## About This Book

On a rain-soaked night in fogbound San Francisco, a penniless young woman on the edge of Chinatown is pulled back from despair by a desert-hardened stranger with a battered suitcase and a stubborn sense of decency. A sudden collision with the city’s shadow economy sends them fleeing into the fog with an identity that isn’t hers—and a road that leads far from the bay. From bohemian chop-houses to an isolated Southwest cattle town where old grudges never quite die, survival will demand nerve, reinvention, and a careful reading of fate. Gritty, atmospheric, and charged with frontier tension, this tale follows two unlikely allies as they step into a world where every name carries a price.
